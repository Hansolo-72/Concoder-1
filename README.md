Idea - To do away with the Election Ink

Azure Blockchain can be used to have biometric verification at the time of voting.
Once biometric verification is done and vote is casted, the system will prevent the the voter from voting a second time.
Also, vote cast by the same voter in a different constituency can be rendered invalid by using Blockchains.

Since Election Ink's purpose is to prevent voters from voting repetedly, Azure Blockchain makes sure that each voter votes only once.
Therefore, there is no use of election ink and it can be dispensed with.
